# 320-Project
Our project for COSC 320

In order to run this project, download abbreviations.csv and all_reviews_content_only.csv using the Google Drive link provided in our project report. Put these files into the /bin folder of this project.

You will now be able to run our two algorithms, Algorithm 1 which has a runtime of O(nm), and Algorithm 2, which has a runtime of O(n + m), where n is the number of words in all reviews, and m is the number of abbreviations that we are checking for.
